        <h1>Introduction!</h1>
        <p>1. my name is Jess, i'm a junior studying communication design.</p>

        <p>2. I've been doing design for a bit now. I wish to better understand how to bridge design and cs capabilities together in my work through this class.
        </p>

        <p>3. I'm a complete newbie when it comes to HTML/CSS/JS!</p>

        <p>4. I want to learn how to write simple, interactive designs to apply to my portfolio works. </p>

        <p>5. A difference between screen vs. paper design is the fact that screen design allows for more interesting interaction between the user and the design. </p>

        <p>6. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com" >The New Yorker</a> I like how the webpage is so clean compared to most other news websites. The tyefaces they chose are also very fitting for the tone of The New Yorker. </p>

        <p>7. <a href="https://fontsinuse.com" >Fonts In Use</a> This website makes it easy for people to search for different font pairings, showing not only the typefaces used, but also how other designers have used them. </p>

        <p>8. <a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us" >Balenciaga</a> I like how simple and organized the website is. </p>
