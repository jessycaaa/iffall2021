                I heard you sold the Amazon
                <br>
                To show the country that you're from
                <br>
                Is where the world should want to be
                <br>
                For a fine something all people need
                <br>
                I'm faithless now
                <br>
                Though we win every time and I don't know how
                <br>
                'Cause I haven't bought you and I haven't sold me
                <br>
                But the people are dying to get on TV
            </p>

                I heard he lives down a river somewhere
                <br>
                With six cars and a grizzly bear
                <br>
                He's got eyes, but he can't see
                <br>
                Well he talks like an angel, but he looks like me
               
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh, Lord!
                <br>
                What have I become?
                <br>
                I'm the face of God, I'm my father's son
                <br>
                I'm not what you think you see
                <br>
                I know you can't eat leather, but you can't stop me
                <br>
                Why would you lie, why would you lie about how you feel?
                <br>
                I've got a mission and my mission is real
                <br>
                Because you've had your chances, yeah you've had enough
                <br>
                I'm gonna burn your house down to spread peace and love
                <br>
                And it gets me down
                <br>
                Oh, Lord, how it gets me down
               
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I heard he lives down a river somewhere
