            Artemesia Lomi or Artemesia Gentileschi was an Italian Baroque painter. 
            Gentileschi is considered among the most accomplished seventeenth-century artists, initially working in the style of Caravaggio. 
            She was producing professional work by the age of fifteen.
            In an era when women had few opportunities to pursue artistic training or work as professional artists, 
            Gentileschi was the first woman to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence and she had an international clientele.
            <br>
            Many of Gentileschi's paintings feature women from myths, allegories, and the Bible, including victims, suicides, and warriors.
            Some of her best known subjects are Susanna and the Elders (particularly the 1610 version in Pommersfelden), Judith Slaying Holofernes (her 1614â€“1620 version is in the Uffizi gallery), and Judith and Her Maidservant (her version of 1625 is in the Detroit Institute of Arts).
            Gentileschi was known for being able to depict the female figure with great naturalism and for her skill in handling colour to express dimension and drama.
